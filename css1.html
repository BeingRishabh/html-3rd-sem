<p id="para1">Tat Tvam Asi is a group in our collage where we come together to join our hands to make our time and moments in our life more joyfull and realize how blessed we are. We do so by going to orphanages and spend some beautifull movents with them as we have been gifted with many things but there are some people in this world who are not lucky as us and even thogh they have potential to do a lot of stuff they dont get the opportunity to do so. Due to lack of family, support, love and money. so this group is here to take a small initiative and share some love and affection to the ones who dont get any support.</p>
<p id="para2">In Tat Tvam Asi we even go to old age homes so let the senior citizen know that they are not alone and we are here to make them cheerfull. Even though there are some people who dont have any time for their parents or they consider them as burden on them they drop them to old age homes :( . Even then when we visit them they become as happy as they have got every happyness in this world. Hence we enjoy those precious movemts and get lots of blessings from them.</p>
<p id="para3">If you also want to become a part of this please contact the creator of this web page "Rishabh Jain"</p>
